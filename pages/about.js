              One of the things that makes Flugelhorn unique is the fact that we
              don't have a traditional studio, but instead work from where we
              please. May it be the beaches of Indonesia or mountains of Mexico.

              This philosophy is reflected in the work we do. We take
              inspiration from everything between the minimalistic interior
              design of Sweden to the the colorful fabrics woven by the Maya
              people of Guatemala. By utilizing the things we see and explore
              we're able to create creative and tailor-made solutions.
